# Knight's Tour
A simple heuristic brute force solution for the knight's tour problem.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once.

A brute-force search for a knight's tour is impractical on all but the smallest boards; for example, on an 8 × 8 board there are approximately 4×1051 possible move sequences, and it is well beyond the capacity to perform operations on such a large set.

To build: `go build -o knights`
